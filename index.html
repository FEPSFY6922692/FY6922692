<p class="ex1" id="Intext">
With environmental impacts being at the forefront of our daily conversations ,one of the first things that come to our minds are road cars.  Everyday hundreds of millions of cars go on the road all over the world it is no surprise that it has one of the biggest impacts in the global greenhouse gas emissions, see figure 1 where the pie chart shows that road transport contributes 11.9% of it which is bigger than any other sectors in the world.

<h3 id="WHAT IS ACTIVE AERODYNAMICS">WHAT IS ACTIVE AERODYNAMICS</h3>
<p class="ex1" id="p1">
The term active aerodynamics refers to the aerodynamic features of vehicles that are able to adjust automatically in real time based on the different driving conditions such as spoilers , rear wings and other parts ,these components have a range of motion that can help optimize the airflow , minimize drag and can increase downforce based on the situation. 
Though active aerodynamics is not a common feature in road cars it is becoming more and more mainstream and are becoming more popular by the day ,this is because of its ability to adapt to different needs when driving such as increasing energy regeneration when braking in electric and hybrid cars etc and decreasing the distance needed to reach a complete stop when braking ,the active aerodynamic technologies can be seen in common road cars such as tesla ,porches and new electric cars.

<p class="ex1" id="p2">
We all know that downforce is an essential part of any vehicle as it provides the grip and increases stability of the car, but with more downforce the top speed of the car decreases and so does the fuel efficiency because the drag increases force needed to move the car ,which is why active aero dynamics is better than conventional aerodynamic components as it allows the car to adjust them to certain needs such as retracting the components.
When driving on a motorway where braking and cornering doesn’t happen as often, by retracting the aerodynamic part to allow the car to reach top speed with less fuel and less time as there is less drag and increase the range of cars. For example the active spoiler on the tesla can help increase the range of motorway driving by 1.6%.In a research done by some alumni of this university they found out that the wing position in an EV at its maximum drag position “results in a 0.4% recuperated energy increase when braking from 300 km/h to 50 km/h in high tire–road friction condition” (Georgiev et al., 2023)
When the car is braking or cornering the components are deployed to act as an air brake  to increase drag so the car can brake faster and have more grip while cornering respectively this is because by having more drag the braking force is now greater which can also lead to higher energy recovery in cars that have the kinetic energy recovery system which increases efficiency.
Active aerodynamics can also help reduce emissions; it does it by reducing drag of the vehicle which means less resistive force against the movement of the car and makes the car more efficient hence leads to less pollutants being emitted into the atmosphere.

<p class="ex1" id="p3">
Though there are many upsides on having a active aero system on your car ,an important point to make is that advanced aerodynamics are not really needed during our daily journeys as it  consists of a lot slower speeds compared to race cars and aero dynamics only really become useful when above certain high speeds,which leads to the system not actually being that usesful ,in fact it becomes a bit of a liability in efficiency ,as it increases the wight of the car which leads to decreased fuel efficiency . In addition in order for the system to work well it has to be made very at a high quality which is not very ideal for roadcars expeacially in the lower quality cars as it would raise the costs significantly  .

<h3 id="future">FUTURE OF ACTIVE AERODYNAMICS </h3>
<p class="ex1" id="p4">
With artificial intelligence being such a crucial part of our daily lives over the past few years ,there is no doubt that the impact of AI on our everyday lives good or bad will continue to increase rapidly. I believe that AI can really help with maximizing the use of active aero dynamics ,for example it can help recognize driving patterns of the car and decide when to use the AA system by using machine learning or it can help engineers to develop better systems by using machine learning to simulate different scenarios and create models to potentially discover new mechanisms etc.

<h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>
<p class="ex1" id="conc">
I think active aerodynamics can be an important part of the future of road cars, as I believe with the rate that technology is being developed nowadays and the implementation of AI in to our daily lives, it really can bring some great improvements to efficiency in road cars and other areas of transport too making active aerodynamics a valuable area of innovation for the future.
